# Project of App-Theme

## Description
I prepared this project after the tutorial with using **HTML5, CSS3**. Especially, to prepare responsive webpages I benefit     
from the `flexboxgrid`. Flexboxgrid is very helpfu to do responsive pages. With the help of **home, about, services, contact 
pages** people can find lots of information about company. Header-footer, showcase, features, info section etc. are very 
colorful met the images. Also the `#56a79a` color give quiet and comfort to people. Navbar is very helpful to get around the 
pages. In contact page, with the help of form people can contact met the company easily.
