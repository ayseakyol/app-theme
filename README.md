## Features
Especially, to prepare responsive webpages I benefit from the `flexboxgrid`. Flexboxgrid is very helpfu to do responsive pages.

## Usage
With the help of **home, about, services, contact pages** people can find lots of information about company.In contact page, with the help of form people can contact met the company easily.  Also the `#56a79a` color give quiet and comfort to people. Navbar is very helpful to get around the 
pages.
