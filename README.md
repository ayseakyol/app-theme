## Installation
With the Visual Studio Code I prepared this project. Also `font-awesome.css` and `flexboxfrid.css` files are used to prepare more responsive and prettier web pages.  

## Features
Especially, to prepare responsive webpages I benefit from the `flexboxgrid`. Flexboxgrid is very helpfu to do responsive pages Responsive modifiers enable specifying different column sizes, offsets, alignment and distribution at xs, sm, md & lg viewport widths..

## Usage
With the help of **home, about, services, contact pages** people can find lots of information about company.In contact page, with the help of form people can contact met the company easily.  Also the `#56a79a` color give quiet and comfort to people. Navbar is very helpful to get around the pages. 

## Inspiration
Thanks to `Traversy Media` for the explanation of flexboxgrid.
